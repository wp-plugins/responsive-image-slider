== Description ==

I'm not a big fan of heavy image sliders. In fact, I think that <a href="https://yoast.com/opinion-on-sliders/" target="_blank">sliders sucks!</a> But here's a slider which doesn't suck at all.

It's an easy, simple & responsive slider, which looks awesome in every single theme. It's really easy to configure this slider.

Just create your slides from the Slider menu & paste the following shortcode where you want to display this theme:

`[tp-unslider]`

Or you can paste following to add slider to your theme:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[tp-unslider]'); ?>`

<h1>Features</h1>

1. Full Width + Responsive
2. Unlimited Slides
3. Keyboard Support
4. Easy to configure option page
5. Lots more!
